Completed the Offensive Security Intro TryHackMe room — a practical, hands-on introduction to offensive security and ethical hacking. Gained experience in web application reconnaissance, identifying common vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation issues), using reconnaissance tools, exploitation in a safe lab environment, and documenting findings with proof-of-concept steps and remediation suggestions. Emphasized ethical guidelines and safe, legal testing practices. Skills applied: web reconnaissance, HTTP basics, Burp Suite workflow, payload crafting, and security writeups.
