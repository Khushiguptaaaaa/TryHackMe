🎉 Completed: Active Directory Basics – TryHackMe

I’ve just finished the Active Directory Basics room on TryHackMe! 🚀
This module introduced the core concepts behind Active Directory (AD)—one of the most essential components in enterprise Windows environments.

🔐 Key Takeaways:

Understanding what Active Directory is and why organizations rely on it

Learning how domains, forests, OUs, and trust relationships work

Basics of Group Policy, authentication, and directory structure

How AD helps manage users, systems, and security in a centralized way

This room gave me a solid foundation for exploring more advanced topics like Privilege Escalation, Kerberoasting, and Windows domain attacks.

🧠 Why This Matters:
Active Directory knowledge is crucial for cybersecurity, system administration, red teaming, and blue teaming. Gaining clarity on AD architecture helps in both attacking and defending enterprise environments.
