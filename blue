🎉 Completed the Blue Room on TryHackMe! 🛡️💻

I’ve successfully completed the Blue room on TryHackMe, where I deployed and hacked into a Windows machine by leveraging common misconfiguration vulnerabilities.

🔍 Key learnings from this hands-on lab:

Understanding Windows service misconfigurations

Enumerating vulnerabilities effectively

Exploiting weak configurations for privilege escalation

Strengthening practical skills in Windows security & exploitation

This room was a great exercise in real-world Windows exploitation techniques and helped reinforce the importance of secure system configurations.

🚀 Onward to more labs and deeper cybersecurity challenges!
