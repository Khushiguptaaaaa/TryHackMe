🔐 Learning Update | TryHackMe – Hashing Basics

I’ve successfully completed the “Hashing Basics” room on TryHackMe, where I learned the fundamentals of hashing and its role in cybersecurity.

📌 Key takeaways:

What hashing functions are and how they work

How hashing is used for password verification (without storing plaintext passwords)

The importance of hashing in file integrity checking

Understanding why hashes are one-way functions and how they differ from encryption

This hands-on learning helped me strengthen my understanding of core security concepts that are essential for secure system design and threat prevention.

Continuing to build practical cybersecurity skills step by step 🚀
