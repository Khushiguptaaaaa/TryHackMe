💻 Just completed the “Linux Fundamentals Part 1” room on TryHackMe!

This room marked the beginning of my journey into mastering Linux fundamentals, an essential skill for cybersecurity and system administration. It introduced me to the Linux command-line environment through hands-on, interactive labs on TryHackMe.

💡 Key Takeaways:

Gained foundational knowledge of the Linux filesystem structure and navigation commands.

Learned to use essential Linux commands such as ls, cd, cat, pwd, and man.

Explored how to interact with files, directories, and permissions from the terminal.

Understood the concept of absolute vs relative paths and user roles.

Developed confidence in working with the command-line interface (CLI) — a critical skill for penetration testing, scripting, and system monitoring.

🧠 Skills Learned:

Linux filesystem navigation

File manipulation and permissions

Command-line basics (ls, cat, cd, mkdir, etc.)

Shell and terminal interaction

Foundational Linux administration

🧩 Platform: TryHackMe – Linux Fundamentals Part 1

📅 Completion: November 2025

Every cybersecurity journey starts with the terminal — and this room helped strengthen that foundation. On to Part 2 next! 🚀
