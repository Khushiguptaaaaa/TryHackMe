🌟 Just Completed the Linux Shells Room on TryHackMe! 🐧💻

I'm excited to share that I’ve completed the Linux Shells room on TryHackMe. This module provided a solid understanding of different Linux shells and their functionalities, along with hands-on practice in scripting and automation.

🔍 Key takeaways:

Understanding various Linux shells (Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.)

Writing and executing shell scripts

Using loops, conditionals, and permissions

Navigating and interacting efficiently with the command-line

This experience has strengthened my foundational Linux skills and boosted my confidence in working with shell environments—an essential skill for cybersecurity and system administration.

Looking forward to diving deeper into more rooms and continuing my learning journey with TryHackMe! 🚀
