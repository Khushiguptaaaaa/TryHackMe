🎯 Learning Milestone Unlocked!

I’ve successfully completed the “Metasploit: Exploitation” room on TryHackMe 🚀

This hands-on lab helped me gain practical experience with Metasploit Framework, one of the most powerful tools used in penetration testing.

🔍 What I learned:

Using Metasploit for network scanning & enumeration

Performing vulnerability assessment

Exploiting vulnerabilities using Metasploit modules

Understanding the attack lifecycle from recon to exploitation

This exercise strengthened my understanding of ethical hacking and real-world exploitation techniques, reinforcing the importance of securing systems against known vulnerabilities.

Grateful to TryHackMe for providing such an interactive and beginner-friendly learning platform. Looking forward to diving deeper into penetration testing and cybersecurity! 🔐💻
