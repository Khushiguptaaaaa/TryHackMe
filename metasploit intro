🚀 Learning Update | TryHackMe 🚀

I’ve successfully completed the “Metasploit: Introduction” room on TryHackMe! 🛡️💻

This room provided a solid introduction to the Metasploit Framework, one of the most powerful tools used in penetration testing and ethical hacking. I learned about:

🔹 The core components of Metasploit
🔹 How Metasploit is structured and organized
🔹 Key concepts like exploits, payloads, modules, and listeners
🔹 How Metasploit is used in real-world security testing

This hands-on experience strengthened my understanding of offensive security fundamentals and how security professionals identify and test system vulnerabilities in a controlled and ethical way.

Excited to keep progressing deeper into cybersecurity and penetration testing! 🔐✨
