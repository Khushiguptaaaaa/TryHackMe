🚀 Just Completed: Metasploit – Meterpreter on TryHackMe! 🔐

I’ve successfully completed the Metasploit: Meterpreter room on TryHackMe, where I took a deep dive into one of the most powerful post-exploitation tools used in penetration testing.

🔍 Key learnings from this hands-on lab:

Understanding Meterpreter and how it operates as an advanced in-memory payload

How in-memory execution helps evade disk-based detection

Exploring post-exploitation capabilities like:

System and process interaction

Privilege escalation concepts

File system and network enumeration

Gaining practical exposure to real-world offensive security techniques

This lab strengthened my understanding of how attackers maintain access after exploitation and how defenders should think from an attacker’s perspective to better secure systems.

💡 Continuous learning and hands-on practice are essential in the field of Cyber Security & Ethical Hacking, and TryHackMe provides an excellent platform for that journey.

Excited to keep learning and exploring more advanced topics! 🚀
