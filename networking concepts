✨ Just Completed the Networking Concepts Room on TryHackMe!

I explored the fundamentals of computer networking, including the ISO/OSI model, TCP/IP protocol suite, and how different layers work together to enable communication across networks.

This room strengthened my understanding of:
🔹 OSI Layer functions
🔹 TCP/IP architecture
🔹 Data encapsulation
🔹 Key networking protocols
🔹 How devices communicate over the internet

Continuous learning in cybersecurity and networking helps me build a stronger technical foundation—and TryHackMe makes the journey hands-on and engaging!

If you're looking to improve your networking basics, I highly recommend this room.
