🚀 Just completed the Networking Essentials room on TryHackMe!

Dived deep into the core building blocks of networking — from how devices automatically configure themselves to how packets find their way across networks. This room gave me hands-on exposure to essential protocols like DHCP, ARP, and routing fundamentals that keep the internet running smoothly.

🔍 What I learned:

How devices obtain IP configuration automatically

How ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses

How routing directs packets to the right destination

Practical scenarios that strengthened my understanding of network communication

Always exciting to sharpen my fundamentals and build a stronger base in cybersecurity and networking. On to the next challenge! 💻🔥
