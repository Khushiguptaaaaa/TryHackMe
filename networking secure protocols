🎉 Completed: Networking Secure Protocols – TryHackMe 🔐

I just wrapped up the Networking Secure Protocols room on TryHackMe!
This module deepened my understanding of how TLS, SSH, and VPNs work behind the scenes to secure network communication and protect data in transit.

🔑 Key Takeaways:

How TLS builds trust and encrypts web traffic

Secure remote access using SSH

VPN tunneling to protect network traffic end-to-end

Importance of certificates, cryptography, and secure authentication

Learning these concepts has strengthened my foundation in network security and safe communication practices. Excited to keep exploring more cybersecurity paths! 🚀
