🚀 Just completed the **Nmap: The Basics** room on **TryHackMe**!

This module was a powerful deep dive into one of the most essential tools in cybersecurity. I explored how to:
🔹 Discover live hosts on a network
🔹 Identify open ports
🔹 Detect service versions
🔹 Understand the fundamentals of network scanning

Nmap is an indispensable tool for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and network troubleshooting — and this room made it easier to grasp and apply its core concepts with hands-on tasks.

Excited to continue building my skills and diving deeper into network security! 💻🔍
