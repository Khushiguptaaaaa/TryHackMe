🚀 I just completed the Networking Core Protocols room on TryHackMe!

This module gave me a solid understanding of the core TCP/IP protocols that keep modern networks running smoothly. I explored how data moves across layers, how devices communicate reliably, and how essential protocols ensure connectivity and performance.

🔍 Key Concepts Covered:
• TCP vs UDP – reliability vs speed
• IP addressing & routing basics
• ARP, ICMP, and DHCP roles in network communication
• Packet structure and flow across the network stack
• How protocols work together to enable end-to-end communication

🧠 This hands-on learning experience strengthened my fundamentals and helped me understand why these protocols are the backbone of every network—whether small LANs or large-scale enterprise systems.

💡 Excited to continue building my networking and cybersecurity skills through more practical labs on TryHackMe!
