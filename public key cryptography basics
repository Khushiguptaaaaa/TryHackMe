🎉 Just Completed the “Public Key Cryptography Basics” Room on TryHackMe! 🔐

Today, I explored the foundations of public key cryptography and learned how algorithms like RSA power secure communication across the internet. The room also covered how these concepts are applied in real-world tools such as SSH, digital signatures, and encryption workflows.

This was a great hands-on experience that strengthened my understanding of how modern cryptographic systems keep our data safe. 🛡️

Excited to continue building my cybersecurity skills—one challenge at a time!
