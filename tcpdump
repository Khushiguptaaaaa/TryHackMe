🎯 **Just Completed: Tcpdump — The Basics (TryHackMe)**

I’m excited to share that I’ve completed the **Tcpdump: The Basics** room on **TryHackMe**! 🚀
This module gave me hands-on experience with one of the most powerful command-line packet analysis tools used in cybersecurity and network troubleshooting.

🔍 **Key Takeaways:**
• Learned how to **capture live network traffic** using tcpdump
• Practiced applying **filters** to isolate specific protocols and packets
• Understood how to **save and analyze PCAP files** for deeper inspection
• Explored techniques for **displaying packet details** in a readable and meaningful format
• Strengthened overall understanding of **network-level visibility and traffic patterns**

💡 This room was super helpful in improving my packet analysis skills and understanding how data flows across a network. A must-try for anyone getting into cybersecurity, networking, or digital forensics!
