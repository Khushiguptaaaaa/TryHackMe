I🎯 Just completed the "Windows Fundamentals Part 2" room on TryHackMe! 💻
In this part of the Windows Fundamentals module, I explored deeper aspects of the Windows operating system — including System Configuration, User Account Control (UAC) settings, Resource Monitoring, and the Windows Registry.
This room helped me understand how Windows manages system performance, security permissions, and critical configuration components — strengthening my foundation for future cybersecurity and system administration challenges. 🔐⚙️
