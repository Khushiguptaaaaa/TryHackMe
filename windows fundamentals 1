🎉 I’ve just completed the “Windows Fundamentals 1” room on TryHackMe! 💻

In this first part of the Windows Fundamentals module, I explored key Windows concepts including:
🪟 The Windows desktop environment
📁 The NTFS file system
🔒 User Account Control (UAC)
⚙️ The Control Panel and system settings
…and much more about how Windows works behind the scenes.

This was a great start to understanding the core components of Windows from a cybersecurity perspective. Excited to continue with Windows Fundamentals 2 next! 🚀
