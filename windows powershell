🚀 Just completed the Windows PowerShell room on TryHackMe!

I explored the fundamentals of PowerShell and understood how this powerful scripting environment helps automate tasks, manage system configurations, and streamline workflows.

🔹 What I learned:

Basics of PowerShell commands and syntax

Working with cmdlets, parameters, and pipelines

File system navigation and management

Using variables and creating simple scripts

Understanding how PowerShell enhances system administration

This room helped me understand why PowerShell is such a valuable tool for IT professionals, security enthusiasts, and system administrators.

If you're building skills in automation, scripting, or system management, I highly recommend checking it out!

✨ Always excited to learn more and upskill.
