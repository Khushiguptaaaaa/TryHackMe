🎉 I just completed the “Wireshark: The Basics” room on TryHackMe! 🕵️‍♂️🔍
Learned how to capture, analyse, and understand network traffic using Wireshark.

This room helped me strengthen my foundations in packet analysis — an essential skill for anyone exploring cybersecurity, networking, or digital forensics.

🔹 Key Skills & Concepts I Learned

📌 Understanding the Wireshark Interface

Layout of the packet list, packet details, and packet bytes

How to efficiently navigate through captures

📌 Applying Display & Capture Filters

Difference between display filters (http, tcp.port == 443, ip.addr == X.X.X.X, etc.)

How to isolate relevant traffic quickly

📌 Analysing Common Protocols

TCP/UDP structure, handshake, flags

HTTP requests & responses

DNS queries & answers

Identifying unusual or suspicious packets

📌 Working with PCAP Files

Opening and interpreting pre-captured network traffic

Following TCP streams to rebuild conversations

Identifying patterns, anomalies, and potential indicators of compromise

📌 Basic Network Forensics

Tracking endpoints

Inspecting packet payloads

Extracting useful information from captures

🔹 Why This Matters

Wireshark is one of the most powerful tools in cybersecurity. Mastering the basics opens up pathways into:

Network analysis

Incident response

Threat hunting

Digital forensics

Penetration testing

This room gave me a strong foundation to move forward into more advanced traffic analysis and protocol-level investigations.

🚀 What’s Next?

I’ll be continuing with more TryHackMe rooms focusing on:

Network security

Traffic investigation

Packet crafting

Intrusion detection systems

🔗 If you're getting into cybersecurity, I highly recommend trying this room — it’s beginner-friendly and extremely practical.
